i have made the changes as you asked of me that is remove the entire code
from the try catch and put only that have to do with files.
i have also fixed it to accomdate such needel and haystack you gave me.


my code works in two way for the needles that have '_' and for those
that doesn't. i used a counter method to find if a needle have '_'.
if it consist of '_' then it goes furter in makeing a badshift that
is proper for it. and if not it would use more or less the one that is
shown in the lecture video.


1. my algorithm is more or less the same as the one in the 
   lecture video on text algorithm. The only difference is 
   that i just changed a little bit of it in my findWildchar
   method so as to fullfill the parameter of the assignment.

2. my program can be compiled as: javac Oblig04.java
                                 java Oblig04 needle.txt haystack.txt

3.the class Oblig04 have the main class

4. i haven't made any assumbtion.

5. no peculiarite that i can think of.

6. it works well with in my own test parameters

7. my code is heavly influnced by the codes from the lecture
   on text algorithms
