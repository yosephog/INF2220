as the feedback you gave me i have changed the pathway to only "dictionary.txt" and
i have used try catch to catch exception but still on the the main method.
about the recursion, i made the wrong assumption that if something can be done
iterativly,it is adviced to avoid recursion (stack usage due to recurstion).

==> n**2 = n the power of 2 or n squared
1. the running time of my method similar words is O(n**2).when the method is called
with the word given as parameter " void similarword(String dat)" it uses several
method from the StringFinder class. of this class the most that are important to us
are similartwo and simiarfour. they have O(n**2). since we are interested in the one
that takes higher time we end up with 0(n**2) for the entire method;

2. my program can be compiled by javac YosephogOblig01.java
                                 java YosephogOblig01

3. the main method is YosephogOblig01.java

4. i assumed that when asked to find the number of nodes on every depth,
   i only generated only how many nodes there are. and print them all 
   out on the terminal.
5. i don't think there are things that are peculare in my code

6. to the extent of my testing ability, everything is working as expected.

7. i am intersed in finding the number of nodes per level part. it is the one that was tricky for me.

8. the swapOne and SimilarOne method is heaviy influnced by the oblig1 of last year assignment. in last year assignment it was given as a help
on the oblig txt file.
