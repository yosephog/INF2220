As you have suggested it i have avoided using hashmap and
used Task[]. as a result my code have deviated from the one
i have deleverd before.
As you requested i have fixed the loop printing out and the
early start in order to get approved

*1 my program is comiled as 
   javac YosephogOblig02.java
    java YosephogOblig02 filename

 

*2 the main method is in Oblig02.java

*3 no assumption is done

*4 there is no pecularity in my code that i can think off.

5. my code works for printing out the loop and for early start.
since that was my priority i have doen that well. slack and late
start doesn't quite work well.

6. my work is heavly influced by stackOverflow and the text book.
